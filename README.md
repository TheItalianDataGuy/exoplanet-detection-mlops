# ðŸŒŒ Exoplanet Detection with MLOps

This project applies end-to-end MLOps practices to build, deploy, and monitor a machine learning model for detecting exoplanets using NASA's Kepler data.

## ðŸš€ Objective
To classify whether a signal observed by the Kepler telescope is an exoplanet or not, using tabular features extracted from light curves.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: [NASA Exoplanet Search Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)

## âœ… Features
- Experiment Tracking with MLflow
- Model Registry
- Workflow Orchestration (Airflow or Prefect)
- Containerized Deployment (Docker)
- Batch Prediction
- Model Monitoring (Evidently)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Reproducible setup with `Makefile`, `requirements.txt`, and pre-commit hooks

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Coming soon...
